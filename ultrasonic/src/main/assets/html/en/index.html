<p>
    <b>MyMusicQoE</b> is a project that intends to analyze the quality of experience of the listeners of musical tracks codified with different codecs and bit rates,
    with the ultimate goal of concluding the best options for a streaming service, taking into account the size of the track and the audio quality felt by the users.

<h4>How to contribute:</h4>
To contribute to this project simply choose, listen and rate music in the application. Choose songs by artist, genre, or create a playlist
of random tracks.<br>
When you are ready you can do the evaluation by pressing <img src="../img/star.png" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align: middle" alt=""> and selecting the evaluation which you find appropriate.<br>
Your rating will be sent promptly, however you can always replay the song again and change your rating if you choose.
<h4>Use Recommendations:</h4>
We ask that your evaluations be well considered and that you evaluate the music in its entirety. If you have any errors in the playback, do not make a weak evaluation of the track.
In case of an error due to application failure, and not, for example, of your connection, submit an <i>Issue</i> on the
